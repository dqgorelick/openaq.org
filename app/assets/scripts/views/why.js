                    Air pollution is the 4th largest risk factor to human health
                    on the planet. According to the World Health Organization,
                    more than 90% of the world breathes unhealthy air, and air
                    pollution disproportionately affects those in developing
                    countries.

                    Air quality data in many places are often only shared in
                    human-readable or temporary ways. Even in countries that
